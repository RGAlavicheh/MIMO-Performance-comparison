# MIMO-Performance-comparison
## Comparison of theoretical capacity with different power allocation strategies.

In this simulation, our objective is to assess the capacity of a Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) system across three distinct modes: Equal Power, Single-Mode, and EigenBeamforming. The EigenBeamforming mode incorporates the utilization of the Waterfilling algorithm. Furthermore, we compare the performance of the MIMO system with that of a Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) system. The simulation allows us to analyze and compare the capacity characteristics of these different system configurations.
